In this **The Odin Project** assignment we are tasked with building a restaurant homepage utilizing Webpack and other modules via JavaScript.

### Features

- Dynamically create web pages when using the navigation bar
- Responsive design

### Technologies

-   Javascript
-   CSS
-   HTML

### What I Learned

This was my first introduction to Webpack and setting up config files manually. I have used React in the past, however the set was up much more automatic via NPM. I found it a great experience to get under the hood, so to speak, and see how to actually build config files with plugins to create dynamic websites.

This is a very simple, local wine shop website.
